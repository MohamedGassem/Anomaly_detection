# Anomaly_detection
The goal was to build a reconstruction loss based anomaly detection model using tf.keras. I had to train an autoencoder to reconstruct Homer Simpson images, then use the trained model to classify Simpson and Flower images. 
This project was made for deep learning classes given in ELTE university in Budapest. Thanks to Kopácsi László and Fodor Ádám for their help.
